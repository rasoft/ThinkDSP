    "# 前言 Preface \n",
    "\n",
    "信号处理是我很感兴趣的一个学科，它被广泛的应用在很多领域。如果理解了信号处理中的一些基本概念，可以帮助我们更好的理解我们生活中所看到和所听到的东西。\n",
    "> Signal processing is one of my favorite topics. It is useful in many areas of science and engineering, and if you understand the fundamental ideas, it provides insight into many things we see in the world, and especially the things we hear.\n",
    "\n",
    "但是，如果你不是学电子或机械工程相关专业的，你很难学懂信号处理这个学科。 因为大多数的相关的书籍（包括学校使用的教材）都是自底向上来讲解的， 先从最基本的数学抽象开始讲起（例如向量）然后逐渐深入，通常缺少理论与实际的联系以及具体的应用示例。\n",
    "> But unless you studied electrical or mechanical engineering, you probably haven’t had a chance to learn about signal processing. The problem is that most books (and the classes that use them) present the material bottom-up, starting with mathematical abstractions like phasors. And they tend to be theoretical, with few applications and little apparent relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "阅读本书之前，你需要有些编程的基础，我们需要使用这项技能来学习其他东西，并完成一些有趣的东西。 \n",
    "> The premise of this book is that if you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other things, and have fun doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "使用编程式的讲解方式，可以很直观的展示大多数的概念。比如在第一章结束后，你就可以通过程序来 分析声音以及其他的信号，生成新的声音了。每一章中，我们都会介绍一项新的技术，以及它在处理真实 信号中的应用。我们会先学习怎样使用这个技术，然后再学习它的工作原理。\n",
    "> With a programming-based approach, I can present the most important ideas right away. By the end of the first chapter, you can analyze sound recordings and other signals, and generate new sounds. Each chapter introduces a new technique and an application you can apply to real signals. At each step you learn how to use a technique first, and then how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "我相信这样的学习形式是更实用也更有趣的（希望你们是这样认为的）。\n",
    "> This approach is more practical and, I hope you’ll agree, more fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.1 本书的读者 Who is this book for? \n",
    "\n",
    "本书使用Python作为编程语言，因此需要读者有一些Python的编程基础并且对面向对象的程序设计有所了解。\n",
    "> The examples and supporting code for this book are in Python. You should know core Python and you should be familiar with object-oriented features, at least using objects if not defining your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你对Python还不太熟的话，你可以先看看我写的另一本书，ThinkPython，它是一本Python的入门书籍，适用于那些没有编程基础的人。如果你有编程经验但是对Python不熟悉，那么你也可以看Mark Lutz的Learning Python。\n",
    "> If you are not already familiar with Python, you might want to start with my other book, Think Python, which is an introduction to Python for people who have never programmed, or Mark Lutz’s Learning Python, which might be better for people with programming experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "本书中还会用到Numpy和Scipy两个Python的扩展库，如果你对此不熟悉也没有关系，我会在使用它们的函数和类的时候，进行简单的解释。\n",
    "> I use NumPy and SciPy extensively. If you are familiar with them already, that’s great, but I will also explain the functions and data structures I use.\n",
    "\n",
    "假设读者了解基本数学，包括复数。不需要很多微积分；除了理解积分和导数就够了。会使用线性代数，但会进行解释。\n",
    "> I assume that the reader knows basic mathematics, including complex numbers. You don’t need much calculus; if you understand the concepts of integration and differentiation, that will do. I use some linear algebra, but I will explain it as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2 本书的代码 Using the code \n",
    "\n",
    "本书的代码和书中使用到的声音文件都托管在Github上： https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP 。 Git是一个版本管理工具，使用它你可以很好的管理和跟踪整个项目中的所有文件，被Git管理项目我们称之为代码库。 Github是一个托管代码库的网站，它提供了很方便的用户界面来管理你的代码库。\n",
    "> The code and sound samples used in this book are available from https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of the files that make up a project. A collection of files under Git’s control is called a “repository”. GitHub is a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories and a convenient web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "本书代码库的Github主页上提供了几种方式来使用其中的代码：\n",
    "> The GitHub homepage for my repository provides several ways to work with the code:\n",
    "* 你可以把我的代码库Fork到自己的账号下。（如果你没有Github账户，你可以免费注册一个）。 Fork后你就有了一个自己的代码库了，你可以使用它来跟踪管理你在学习过程中编写的代码。 然后，你需要使用clone命令来把代码库中的代码复制到你的本地电脑中。\n",
    "> You can create a copy of my repository on GitHub by pressing the Fork button. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, you’ll need to create one. After forking, you’ll have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write while working on this book. Then you can clone the repo, which means that you copy the files to your computer.\n",
    "* 如果你没有Github账号，你也可以直接clone我的代码库。但是这样你就不能把你写的代码上传到Github上了，不过你依然可以在本地跟踪和管理你的代码。\n",
    "> Or you could clone my repository. You don’t need a GitHub account to do this, but you won’t be able to write your changes back to GitHub.\n",
    "* 如果你不想使用Git，你还可以把代码库下载成一个zip文件。（Github页面的右下角有一个下载的按钮）\n",
    "> If you don’t want to use Git at all, you can download the files in a Zip file using the button in the lower-right corner of the GitHub page.\n",
    "\n",
    "本书中的所有代码均可以工作在Python2和Python3。\n",
    "> All of the code is written to work in both Python 2 and Python 3 with no translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "我在开发这些代码的时候，使用了Continuum Analytics公司开发的Anaconda，它是一个免费的Python发行版，其中包含了 我们将要用到的大部分Python包。Anaconda的安装非常简单，默认情况下它可以在用户级权限下进行安装，不需要管理员权限。 它同时支持Python2和Python3。你可以在 https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ 下载Anaconda。\n",
    "> I developed this book using Anaconda from Continuum Analytics, which is a free Python distribution that includes all the packages you’ll need to run the code (and lots more). I found Anaconda easy to install. By default it does a user-level installation, not system-level, so you don’t need administrative privileges. And it supports both Python 2 and Python 3. You can download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你不想使用Anaconda，你需要自己手动安装以下的Python包：\n",
    "> If you don’t want to use Anaconda, you will need the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numpy：用于数值计算， http://www.numpy.org/\n",
    "> NumPy for basic numerical computation, http://www.numpy.org/;\n",
    "* Scipy： 用于科学计算， http://www.scipy.org/\n",
    "> SciPy for scientific computation, http://www.scipy.org/;\n",
    "* matplotlib：用于作图， http://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "> matplotlib for visualization, http://matplotlib.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "虽然这些程序包都是很常用的，但是它们不会包含在基本的Python的安装包中，因此你需要手动安装。 在某些环境下，它们有可能不太好安装，如果你在安装的时候遇到问题，我建议你使用Anaconda或其他的Python发行版， 一般这些发行版的Python都默认包含了这些程序包。\n",
    "> Although these are commonly used packages, they are not included with all Python installations, and they can be hard to install in some environments. If you have trouble installing them, I recommend using Anaconda or one of the other Python distributions that include these packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "本书的练习有的需要使用Jupyter notebook，如果你对此不熟悉，可以参考 http://jupyter.org 。\n",
    "> Most exercises use Python scripts, but some also use Jupyter notebooks. If you have not used Jupyter before, you can read about it at http://jupyter.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "使用Jupyter有三种方式：\n",
    "> There are three ways you can work with the Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 如果安装了Anaconda，其中默认包含了Jupyter，你可以使用命令行来启动Jupyter服务:\n",
    "> Run Jupyter on your computer If you installed Anaconda, you probably got Jupyter by default. To check, start the server from the command line, like this:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```$ jupyter notebook```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  如果没有安装Jupyter，可以使用下面的命令行进行安装:\n",
    "  > If it’s not installed, you can install it in Anaconda like this:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```$ conda install jupyter```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  当你启动了Jupyter服务后，它会在浏览器中自动的打开一个新的页面也就是Jupyter notebook的主页。\n",
    "  > When you start the server, it should launch your default web browser or create a new tab in an open browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 在Binder中运行Jupyter Binder是一个运行Jupyter的网络服务，通过 http://mybinder.org/repo/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP 你可以直接打开 本书的Jupyter主页，并且你可以在编辑和运行里面的代码，\n",
    "> Run Jupyter on Binder Binder is a service that runs Jupyter in a virtual machine. If you follow this link, http://mybinder.org/repo/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP, you should get a Jupyter home page with the notebooks for this book and the supporting data and scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  但是你编写和改动的代码不会被保存起来，如果你把页面关闭了或者长时间没有操作（1个小时），那么这些代码会消失。\n",
    "  > You can run the scripts and modify them to run your own code, but the virtual machine you run in is temporary. Any changes you make will disappear, along with the virtual machine, if you leave it idle for more than about an hour.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* 在nbviewer中查看 本书还会提供在noviewer中的链接，在nbviewer中你仅仅可以静态展示代码和结果。你可以通过nbviewer的链接来阅读本书的代码， 也可以播放示例中的声音，但是你不能进行改动也不能运行它们，交互式的控件也使用不了。\n",
    "> View notebooks on nbviewer When we refer to notebooks later in the book, we will provide links to nbviewer, which provides a static view of the code and results. You can use these links to read the notebooks and listen to the examples, but you won’t be able to modify or run the code, or use the interactive widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck, and have fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributor List\n",
    "If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to downey@allendowney.com. If I make a change based on your feedback, I will add you to the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you include at least part of the sentence the error appears in, that makes it easy for me to search. Page and section numbers are fine, too, but not as easy to work with. Thanks!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before I started writing, my thoughts about this book benefited from conver- sations with Boulos Harb at Google and Aurelio Ramos, formerly at Harmonix Music Systems.\n",
    "* During the Fall 2013 semester, Nathan Lintz and Ian Daniher worked with me on an independent study project and helped me with the first draft of this book.\n",
    "* On Reddit’s DSP forum, the anonymous user RamjetSoundwave helped me fix a problem with my implementation of Brownian Noise. And andodli found a typo.\n",
    "* In Spring 2015 I had the pleasure of teaching this material along with Prof. Oscar Mur-Miranda and Prof. Siddhartan Govindasamy. Both made many suggestions and corrections.\n",
    "* Silas Gyger corrected an arithmetic error.\n",
    "* Giuseppe Masetti sent a number of very helpful suggestions.\n",
    "* Eric Peters sent many helpful suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special thanks to Freesound, which is the source of many of the sound samples I use in this book, and to the Freesound users who uploaded those sounds. I include some of their wave files in the GitHub repository for this book, using the original file names, so it should be easy to find their sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, most Freesound users don’t make their real names available, so I can only thank them using their user names. Samples used in this book were con- tributed by Freesound users: iluppai, wcfl10, thirsk, docquesting, kleeb, landup, zippi1, themusicalnomad, bcjordan, rockwehrmann, marcgascon7, jcveliz. Thank you all!"
